# Overview
This project focused on the weather temperature in June and December, looking at different statistics between the two periods to help assess whether an ice cream/surf shop would have good weather conditions in which to operate.

# Results
1) The average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees which shows that there is very little fluctuation between the two periods.
2) The maximum temperatures also are remarkably simalar as the high in June is 85 and the high in December is 83.
3) The minimum temperature of 56 in December and 64 in June shows the greatest variance between temps, but the average temps suggest it is much warmer than there coldest days and shouldn't have a major impact on business.

# Summary
In conclusion both of the months are relatively similar in temp and business is more likely to fail to other reasons than the temperature.
